OpenLabs iOS BlindTest
======================

This is a simple blind test using MP3 files as audio source.

Exercises:
----------

The app was intended to be done in 5 parts:

* 1) Create a button that will play a song randomly when tapped.
* 2) Display 4 music choices to the user.
* 3) Handle the user's choice.
* 4) Add a score management.
* 5) Use a UIProgressView to show the time remaining.

Start the exercises:
--------------------

You should start at the tag Exercise_0 :

    git clone https://adrienbrault@github.com/Supinfo-AppleLab-Paris/BlindTest.git
    cd BlindTest
    git checkout Exercise_0

To be able to play musics, you have to drag ".mp3" files into the xcode project. (Should be in the MP3 group)

Use git & Github power:
